        <p>莊子曰：「夫子固拙於用大矣。宋人有善為不龜手之藥者，世世以洴澼絖為事。客聞之，請買其方百金。聚族而謀曰：『我世世為洴澼絖，不過數金；今一朝而鬻技百金，請與之。』客得之，以說吳王。越有難，吳王使之將，冬與越人水戰，大敗越人，裂地而封之。能不龜手，一也；或以封，或不免於洴澼絖，則所用之異也。今子有五石之瓠，何不慮以為大樽而浮乎江湖，而憂其瓠落無所容？則夫子猶有蓬之心也夫！」</p>

            <div class="translation-title">James Legge (1891):</div>
            <p>Huizi told Zhuangzi, saying, 'The king of Wei sent me some seeds of a large calabash, which I sowed. The fruit, when fully grown, could contain five piculs (of anything). I used it to contain water, but it was so heavy that I could not lift it by myself. I cut it in two to make the parts into drinking vessels; but the dried shells were too wide and unstable and would not hold (the liquor); nothing but large useless things! Because of their uselessness I knocked them to pieces.' Zhuangzi replied, 'You were indeed stupid, my master, in the use of what was large. There was a man of Song who was skilful at making a salve which kept the hands from getting chapped; and (his family) for generations had made the bleaching of cocoon-silk their business. A stranger heard of it, and proposed to buy the art of the preparation for a hundred ounces of silver. The kindred all came together, and considered the proposal. "We have," said they, "been bleaching cocoon-silk for generations, and have only gained a little money. Now in one morning we can sell to this man our art for a hundred ounces - let him have it." The stranger accordingly got it and went away with it to give counsel to the king of Wu, who was then engaged in hostilities with Yue. The king gave him the command of his fleet, and in the winter he had an engagement with that of Yue, on which he inflicted a great defeat, and was invested with a portion of territory taken from Yue. The keeping the hands from getting chapped was the same in both cases; but in the one case it led to the investiture (of the possessor of the salve), and in the other it had only enabled its owners to continue their bleaching. The difference of result was owing to the different use made of the art. Now you, Sir, had calabashes large enough to hold five piculs; why did you not think of making large bottle-gourds of them, by means of which you could have floated over rivers and lakes, instead of giving yourself the sorrow of finding that they were useless for holding anything. Your mind, my master, would seem to have been closed against all intelligence!'</p>

        <div id="lin" class="translation" style="display: none;">
            <div class="translation-title">Lin Yutang (1942):</div>
            <p>Hueitse said to Chuangtse, "The Prince of Wei gave me a seed of a large-sized kind of gourd. I planted it, and it bore a fruit as big as a five bushel measure. Now had I used this for holding liquids, it would have been too heavy to lift; and had I cut it in half for ladles, the ladles would have been too flat for such purpose. Certainly it was a huge thing, but I had no use for it and so broke it up."</p>
            <p>"It was rather you did not know how to use large things," replied Chuangtse. "There was a man of Sung who had a recipe for salve for chapped hands, his family having been silk-washers for generations. A stranger who had heard of it came and offered him a hundred ounces of silver for this recipe; whereupon he called together his clansmen and said, 'We have never made much money by silk-washing. Now, we can sell the recipe for a hundred ounces in a single day. Let the stranger have it.'</p>
            <p>"The stranger got the recipe, and went and had an interview with the Prince of Wu. The Yu:eh State was in trouble, and the Prince of Wu sent a general to fight a naval battle with Yu:eh at the beginning of winter. The latter was totally defeated, and the stranger was rewarded with a piece of the King's territory. Thus, while the efficacy of the salve to cure chapped hands was in both cases the same, its applications were different. Here, it secured a title; there, the people remained silk-washers.</p>
            <p>"Now as to your five-bushel gourd, why did you not make a float of it, and float about over river and lake? And you complain of its being too flat for holding things! I fear your mind is stuffy inside."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="feng" class="translation" style="display: none;">
            <div class="translation-title">Feng Youlan (1964):</div>
            <p>Hui Tzu said to Chuang Tzu: "The king of Wei sent me some calabash seeds. I planted them and they bore a fruit as big as a five-bushel measure. I used it as a vessel for holding water, but it was not solid enough to hold it. I cut the calabash in two for ladles, but each of them was too shallow to hold anything. Because of this uselessness, I knocked them to pieces."</p>
            <p>"Sir," said Chuang Tzu, "it was rather you who did not know how to use large things. There was a man of Sung who had a recipe for salve for chapped hands. From generation to generation, his family made silk washing their occupation. A stranger heard of this and proposed to offer him 100 ounces of gold for the recipe. The kindred all came together to consider this proposal. 'We have,' said they, 'been washing silk for generations. What we gained is not more than a few ounces of gold. Now in one morning we can sell this art for 100 ounces. Let us give it to the stranger.'</p>
            <p>"So the stranger got it. He went and informed the king of Wu. When Wu and Yueh were at war, the king of Wu gave him the command of his fleet. In the winter he had a naval engagement with Yueh, in which the latter was totally defeated.</p>
            <p>"The stranger was rewarded with a fief and a title. Thus while the efficiency of the salve to cure the chapped hands was in both cases the same, yet here it secured him a title, there, nothing more than a capacity for washing silk. This was because its application was different. Now you, sir, have this five-bushel calabash; why did you not make of it a large bottle gourd, by means of which you could float in rivers and lakes? Instead of this, you were sorry that it was useless for holding anything. I think your mind is rather wooly."</p>

            <div class="translation-title">Burton Watson (1968):</div>
            <p>Huizi said to Zhuangzi, "The king of Wei gave me some seeds of a huge gourd. I planted them, and when they grew up, the fruit was big enough to hold five piculs. I tried using it for a water container, but it was so heavy I couldn't lift it. I split it in half to make dippers, but they were so large and unwieldy that I couldn't dip them into anything. It's not that the gourds weren't fantastically big—but I decided they were of no use, and so I smashed them to pieces."</p>
            <p>Zhuangzi said, "You certainly are dense when it comes to using big things! In Song there was a man who was skilled at making a salve to prevent chapped hands, and generation after generation his family made a living by bleaching silk in water. A traveler heard about the salve and offered to buy the prescription for a hundred measures of gold. The man called everyone to a family council. 'For generations we've been bleaching silk, and we've never made more than a few measures of gold,' he said. 'Now, if we sell our secret, we can make a hundred measures in one morning. Let's let him have it!' The traveler got the salve and introduced it to the king of Wu, who was having trouble with the state of Yue. The king put the man in charge of his troops, and that winter they fought a naval battle with the men of Yue and gave them a bad beating. A portion of the conquered territory was awarded to the man as a fief. The salve had the power to prevent chapped hands in either case; but one man used it to get a fief, while the other one never got beyond silk bleaching—because they used it in different ways. Now you had a gourd big enough to hold five piculs. Why didn't you think of making it into a great tub so you could go floating around the rivers and lakes, instead of worrying because it was too big and unwieldy to dip into things! Obviously you still have a lot of underbrush in your head!"</p>

            <p>惠子所以起此大匏之譬，以譏莊子之書，雖復詞旨恢弘，而不切機務，故致此詞而更相激發者也。惠施既得瓠種，藝之成就，生子甚大，容受五石，仍持此瓠以盛水漿，虛脆不堅，故不能自勝舉也。用而盛水，虛脆不能自勝；分剖為瓢，平淺不容多物。眾謂無用，打破棄之。刺莊子之言，不救時要，有同此瓠，應須屏削也。</p>
            <p>宋人隆冬涉水，漂絮以作牽離，手指生瘡，拘坼有同龜背。故世世相承，家傳此藥，令其手不拘坼，常得漂絮水中，保斯事業，永無虧替。</p>
            <p>吳越比鄰，地帶江海，兵戈相接，必用艫船，戰士隆冬，手多拘坼。而客素稟雄才，天生睿智，既得方術，遂說吳王。越國兵難侵吳，吳王使為將帥，賴此名藥，而兵手不拘坼。旌旗才舉，越人亂轍。獲此大捷，獻凱而旋，勳庸克著，胙之茆土。</p>
            <p>方藥無工拙而用者有殊，故行客得之以封侯，宋人用之以洴澼，此則所用工拙之異。</p>
            <p>樽者，漆之如酒罇，以繩結縛，用渡江湖，南人所謂腰舟者也。言大瓠浮汎江湖，可以舟船淪溺；至教興行世境，可以濟渡群迷。而惠生既有蓬心，未能直達玄理，故妄起掊擊之譬，譏刺莊子之書。為用失宜，深可歎之。</p>
