        <p>連叔曰：「其言謂何哉？」</p>
        <p>曰：「藐姑射之山，有神人居焉，肌膚若冰雪，綽淖約若處子。不食五穀，吸風飲露。乘雲氣，御飛龍，而遊乎四海之外。其神凝，使物不疵而年穀熟。吾以是狂而不信也。」</p>
        <p>連叔曰：「然。瞽者無以與乎文章之觀，聾者無以與乎鐘鼓之聲。豈唯形骸有聾盲哉？夫知亦有之。是其言也，猶時女也。之人也，之德也，將旁礡萬物以為一世蘄求也乎亂，孰弊弊焉以天下為事！之人也，物莫之傷，大浸稽天而不溺，大旱金石流土山焦而不熱。是其塵垢粃穅，將猶陶鑄堯舜者也，孰肯以物為事！宋人資章甫而適諸越，越人斷髮文身，無所用之。堯治天下之民，平海內之政，往見四子藐姑射之山，汾水之陽，窅然喪其天下焉。」</p>

            <p>Jian Wu asked Lian Shu, saying, 'I heard Jie Yu talking words which were great, but had nothing corresponding to them (in reality); once gone, they could not be brought back. I was frightened by them; they were like the Milky Way which cannot be traced to its beginning or end. They had no connexion with one another, and were not akin to the experiences of men.' 'What were his words?' asked Lian Shu, and the other replied, (He said) that 'Far away on the hill of Gu Ye there dwelt a Spirit-like man whose flesh and skin were (smooth) as ice and (white) as snow; that his manner was elegant and delicate as that of a virgin; that he did not eat any of the five grains, but inhaled the wind and drank the dew; that he mounted on the clouds, drove along the flying dragons, rambling and enjoying himself beyond the four seas; that by the concentration of his spirit-like powers he could save men from disease and pestilence, and secure every year a plentiful harvest.' These words appeared to me wild and incoherent and I did not believe them. 'So it is,' said Lian Shu. 'The blind have no perception of the beauty of elegant figures, nor the deaf of the sound of bells and drums. And is it only the bodily senses of which deafness and blindness can be predicated? There is also a similar defect in the intelligence; and of this your words supply an illustration in yourself. That man, with those attributes, though all things were one mass of confusion, and he heard in that condition the whole world crying out to him to be rectified, would not have to address himself laboriously to the task, as if it were his business to rectify the world. Nothing could hurt that man; the greatest floods, reaching to the sky, could not drown him, nor would he feel the fervour of the greatest heats melting metals and stones till they flowed, and scorching all the ground and hills. From the dust and chaff of himself, he could still mould and fashion Yaos and Shuns - how should he be willing to occupy himself with things?' A man of Song, who dealt in the ceremonial caps (of Yin), went with them to Yue, the people of which cut off their hair and tattooed their bodies, so that they had no use for them. Yao ruled the people of the kingdom, and maintained a perfect government within the four seas. Having gone to see the four (Perfect) Ones on the distant hill of Gu Ye, when (he returned to his capital) on the south of the Fen water, his throne appeared no more to his deep-sunk oblivious eyes.</p>

            <p>Chien Wu said to Lien Shu, "I heard Chieh Yu: talk on high and fine subjects endlessly. I was greatly startled at what he said, for his words seemed interminable as the Milky Way, but they are quite detached from our common human experience."</p>
            <p>"What was it?" asked Lien Shu.</p>
            <p>"He declared," replied Chien Wu, "that on the Miao-ku-yi mountain there lives a divine one, whose skin is white like ice or snow, whose grace and elegance are like those of a virgin, who eats no grain, but lives on air and dew, and who, riding on clouds with flying dragons for his team, roams beyond the limit's of the mortal regions. When his spirit gravitates, he can ward off corruption from all things, and bring good crops. That is why I call it nonsense, and do not believe it."</p>
            <p>"Well," answered Lien Shu, "you don't ask a blind man's opinion of beautiful designs, nor do you invite a deaf man to a concert. And blindness and deafness are not physical only. There is blindness and deafness of the mind. His words are like the unspoiled virgin. The good influence of such a man with such a character fills all creation. Yet because a paltry generation cries for reform, you would have him busy himself about the details of an empire!</p>
            <p>"Objective existences cannot harm. In a flood which reached the sky, he would not be drowned. In a drought, though metals ran liquid and mountains were scorched up, he would not be hot. Out of his very dust and siftings you might fashion two such men as Yao and Shun(6). And you would have him occupy himself with objectives!"</p>
            <p>A man of the Sung State carried some ceremonial caps to the Yu:eh tribes for sale. But the men of Yu:eh used to cut off their hair and paint their bodies, so that they had no use for such things.</p>
            <p>The Emperor Yao ruled all under heaven and governed the affairs of the entire country. After he paid a visit to the four sages of the Miao-ku-yi Mountain, he felt on his return to his capital at Fenyang that the empire existed for him no more.</p>

            <p>Chien Wu said to Lien Shu: "I heard from Chieh Yu some utterances that were great but could not be justiﬁ ed. Once stated, there is no end of his tale. I was greatly startled at what he said. It seemed to be as boundless as the Milky Way. It was very improbable and far removed from human experience."</p>
            <p>"What did he say?" asked Lien Shu.</p>
            <p>"He said," replied Chien Wu, "far away on the mountain of Ku Yi, there lived a spiritual man. His ﬂ esh and skin were like ice and snow. His manner was elegant and graceful as that of a maiden. He did not eat any of the ﬁ ve grains, but inhaled the wind and drank the dew." "He rode on clouds, drove along the ﬂ ying dragons, and thus rambled beyond the four seas."</p>
            <p>"His spirit is compact."</p>
            <p>"'Yet he could save things from corruption and secure every year a plentiful harvest.' I thought all these sayings were nonsense and refused to believe in them."</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Lien Shu, "the blind have nothing to do with beauty, nor the deaf with music. There are not only physical blindness and deafness, there are also the intellectual. Of the latter you yourself supply an illustration. That man, with those virtues, would embrace all things. According to him, everything in the world is longing for peace; why should there be some who address themselves laboriously to govern the empire?"</p>
            <p>"That man, nothing can hurt. In a ﬂood reaching the sky, he would not be drowned. In a drought, though metals ran liquid and mountains were scorched, he would not feel hot."</p>
            <p>"Even his dust and siftings could still fashion and mold Yao and Shun. How should he will to occupy himself with things?"</p>
            <p>A man of the Sung state carried some ceremonial caps to the Yueh state. But the men of Yueh used to cut off their hair and paint their body, so that they had no use of such things. Yao ruled the people of the empire and maintained a perfect government within the four seas. He went to see the four sages in the distant mountain of Ku Yi. On returning to his capital south of the Fen River, he silently forgot his empire.</p>

            <p>Jian Wu said to Lian Shu, "I was listening to Jie Yu's talk— big and nothing to back it up, going on and on without turning around. I was completely dumbfounded at his words —no more end than the Milky Way, wild and wide of the mark, never coming near human affairs!" "What were his words like?" asked Lian Shu. "He said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway Gushe Mountain, with skin like ice or snow and gentle andshy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the four seas. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. I thought this all was insane and refused to believe it." "You would!" said Lian Shu. "We can't expect a blind man to appreciate beautiful patterns or a deaf man to listen to bells and drums. And blindness and deafness are not confined to the body alone—the understanding has them, too, as your words just now have shown. This man, with this virtue of his, is about to embrace the ten thousand things and roll them into one. Though the age calls for reform, why should he wear himself out over the affairs of the world? There is nothing that can harm this man. Though floodwaters pile up to the sky, he will not drown. Though a great drought melts metal and stone and scorches the earth and hills, he will not be burned. From his dust and leavings alone, you could mold a Yao or a Shun! Why should he consent to bother about mere things?" A man of Song who sold ceremonial hats made a trip to Yue, but the Yue people cut their hair short and tattooed their bodies and had no use for such things. Yao brought order to the people of the world and directed the government of all within the seas. But he went to see the Four Masters of the faraway Gushe Mountain, [and when he got home] north of the Fen River, he was dazed and had forgotten his kingdom there.</p>

            <p><strong>郭象注：</strong></p>
            <p>此皆寄言耳。夫神人即今所謂聖人也。夫聖人雖在廟堂之上，然其心無異於山林之中，世豈識之哉！徒見其戴黃屋，佩玉璽，便謂足以纓紱其心矣；見其歷山川，同民事，便謂足以憔悴其神矣；豈知至至者之不虧哉！今言王德之人而寄之此山，將明世所無由識，故乃託之於絕垠之外而推之於視聽之表耳。處子者，不以外傷內。</p>
            <p>夫體神居靈而窮理極妙者，雖靜默閒堂之裏，而玄同四海之表，故乘兩儀而御六氣，同人群而驅萬物。</p>
            <p>苟無物而不順，則浮雲斯乘矣；</p>
            <p>無形而不載，則飛龍斯御矣。</p>
            <p>遺身而自得，雖淡然而不待，坐忘行忘，忘而為之，故行若曳枯木，止若聚死灰，是以云其神凝也。其神凝，則不凝者自得矣。世皆齊其所見而斷之，豈嘗信此哉！</p>
            <p>聖人形同枯木，心若死灰，本跡一時，動寂俱妙，凝照潛通，虛懷利物。遂使四時順序，五穀豐登，人無災害，物無夭枉。聖人之處世，有此功能，肩吾未悟至言，謂為狂而不信。</p>
            <p>夫聖人之心，極兩儀之至會，窮萬物之妙數。故能體化合變，無往不可，旁礡萬物，無物不然。世以亂故求我，我無心也。我苟無心，亦何為不應世哉！然則體玄而極妙者，其所以會通萬物之性，而陶鑄天下之化，以成堯舜之名者，常以不為為之耳。孰弊弊焉勞神苦思，以事為事，然後能乎！</p>
            <p>無往而不安，則所在皆適，死生無變於己，況溺熱之間哉！故至人之不嬰乎禍難，非避之也，推理直前而自然與吉會。</p>
            <p>夫堯之無用天下為，亦猶越人之無所用章甫耳。然遺天下者，固天下之所宗。天下雖宗堯，而堯未嘗有天下也，故窅然喪之，而嘗遊心於絕冥之境，雖寄坐萬物之上而未始不逍遙也。</p>
            <p>四子者蓋寄言，以明堯之不一於堯耳。夫堯實冥矣，其跡則堯也。自跡觀冥，內外異域，未足怪也。世徒見堯之為堯，豈識其冥哉！故將求四子於海外而據堯於所見，因謂與物同波者，失其所以逍遙也。然未知至遠之（跡）〔所〕順者更近，而至高之所會者反下也。若乃厲然以獨高為至而不夷乎俗累，斯山谷之士，非無待者也，奚足以語至極而遊無窮哉！</p>
            <p>堯舜者，世事之名耳；為名者，非名也。故夫堯舜者，豈直堯舜而已哉？必有神人之實焉。今所稱堯舜者，徒名其塵垢粃穅耳。</p>

            <p>肩吾連叔，並古之懷道人也。接輿者，姓陸，名通，字接輿，楚之賢人隱者也，與孔子同時。而佯狂不仕，常以躬耕為務，楚王知其賢，聘以黃金百鎰，車駟二乘，並不受。於是夫負妻戴，以遊山海，莫知所終。肩吾聞接輿之言過無準的，故問連叔，詢其義旨。而言吾聞言於接輿者，聞接輿之言也。莊生寄三賢以明堯之一聖，所聞之狀具列於下文也。</p>
            <p>所聞接輿之言，恢弘而無的當，一往而陳梗概，曾無反覆可尋。吾竊聞之，驚疑怖恐，猶如上天河漢，迢遞清高，尋其源流，略無窮極也。</p>
            <p>逕庭，猶過差，亦是直往不顧之貌也。謂接輿之言，不偶於俗，多有過差，不附世情，故大言不合於里耳也。</p>
            <p>藐，遠也。山海經云：姑射山在寰海之外，有神聖之人，戢機應物。時須揖讓，即為堯舜；時須干戈，即為湯武。綽約，柔弱也。處子，未嫁女也。</p>
            <p>言聖人動寂相應，則空有並照，雖居廊廟，無異山林，和光同塵，在染不染。冰雪取其潔淨，綽約譬以柔和，處子不為物傷，姑射語其絕遠。此明堯之盛德，窈冥玄妙，故託之絕垠之外，推之視聽之表。斯蓋寓言耳，亦何必有姑射之實乎，宜忘言以尋其所況。此即肩吾述己昔聞以答連叔之辭者也。</p>
            <p>五穀者，黍稷麻菽麥也。</p>
            <p>言神聖之人，降生應物，挺淳粹之精靈，稟陰陽之秀氣。雖順物以資待，非五穀之所為，託風露以清虛，豈四時之能變也！</p>
            <p>智照靈通，無心順物，故曰乘雲氣。不疾而速，變現無常，故曰御飛龍。寄生萬物之上而神超六合之表，故曰遊乎四海之外也。</p>
            <p>瞽者，謂眼無眹縫，冥冥如鼓皮也。</p>
            <p>聾者，耳病也。</p>
            <p>盲者，眼根敗也。</p>
            <p>夫目視耳聽，蓋有物之常情也，既瞽既聾，不可示之以聲色也。亦猶至言妙道，唯懸解者能知。愚惑之徒，終身未悟，良由智障盲闇，不能照察，豈唯形質獨有之耶！</p>
            <p>時女，少年處室之女也。指此接輿之言，猶如窈窕之女，綽約凝潔，為君子所求，但知之聾盲者謂無此理也。</p>
            <p>之是語助，亦歎美也。旁礡，猶混同也。蘄，求也。孰，誰也。之人者，歎堯是聖人；之德者，歎堯之盛德也。</p>
            <p>言聖人德合二儀，道齊群品，混同萬物，制馭百靈。世道荒淫，蒼生離亂，故求大聖君臨安撫。而虛舟懸鏡，應感無心，誰肯勞形弊智，經營區宇，以事為事，然後能事。故老子云為無為，事無事，又云取天下常以無事，及其有事不足以取天下也。</p>
            <p>以為一世蘄乎亂，亂，治也，猶虞書亂而敬之亂。舉世望治，德握其符，神人無功，豈肯有勞天下之跡！老子云，我無為而民自化，此之謂也。</p>
            <p>夫達於生死，則無死無生；宜於水火，則不溺不熱。假令陽九流金之災，百六滔天之禍，紛紜自彼，於我何為！故郭象注云，死生無變於己，何況溺熱之間也哉！</p>
            <p>散為塵，膩為垢，穀不熟為秕，穀皮曰糠，皆猥物也。鎔金曰鑄，範土曰陶。</p>
            <p>諡法，翼善傳聖曰堯，仁聖盛明曰舜。夫堯至（本）〔聖〕，妙絕形名，混跡同塵，物甘其德，故立名諡以彰聖體。然名者粗法，不異秕糠；諡者世事，何殊塵垢。既而矯諂佞妄，將彼塵垢鍛鑄為堯，用此秕糠埏埴作舜。豈知妙體胡可言邪！是以誰肯以物為事者也。</p>
            <p>越國逼近江湖，斷髮文身，以避蛟龍之難也。章甫，冠名也。故孔子生於魯，衣縫掖；長於宋，冠章甫。而宋實微子之裔，越乃太伯之苗，二國貿遷往來，乃以章甫為貨。且章甫本充首飾，必須雲鬟承冠，越人斷髮文身，資貨便成無用。亦如榮華本猶滯著，富貴起自驕矜。堯既體道洞忘，故能無用天下。故郭象注云，夫堯之無所用天下為，亦猶越人無所用章甫耳。</p>
            <p>治，言緝理；政，言風教。此合喻也。</p>
            <p>汾水出自太原，西入於河。水北曰陽，則今之晉州平陽縣，在汾水北，昔堯都也。</p>
            <p>窅然者寂寥，是深遠之名。</p>
            <p>喪之言忘，是遣蕩之義。</p>
            <p>而四子者，四德也：一本，二跡，三非本非跡，四非非本跡也。言堯反照心源，洞見道境，超茲四句，故言往見四子也。</p>
            <p>夫聖人無心，有感斯應，故能緝理萬邦，和平九土。雖復凝神四子，端拱而坐汾陽；統御萬機，窅然而喪天下。斯蓋即本即跡，即體即用，空有雙照，動寂一時。是以姑射不異汾陽，山林豈殊黃屋！世人齊其所見，曷嘗信此邪！而馬彪將四子為齧缺，便未達於遠理；劉璋推汾水於射山，更迷惑於近事。今所解釋，稍異於斯。故郭象注云，四子者蓋寄言，明堯之不一於堯耳，世徒見堯之跡，豈識其冥哉！</p>
